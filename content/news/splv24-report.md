From the 29th July to 2nd August 2024,
the fifth edition of the
[Scottish Programming Languages & Verification Summer School](https://spli.scot/splv/2024-strathclyde/)
(SPLV 2024)
was organised by the
[MSP Group](https://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/)
of the
[University of Strathclyde](https://strath.ac.uk/).

With 58 attendees from around the world,
(including Scotland, England, the EU, and USA)
students had the ability to engage with topics across programming languages and verification research.

The core courses for SPLV 2024 were

  + Category Theory by [Chris Heunen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/cheunen/)
  + Type Theory by [Conor Mc Bride](https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/)

The invited course was:

  + Introduction to Separation Logic by [Jean-Marie Madiot](https://madiot.fr/)

The specialised courses were:

  + Type Theory & Implicit Complexity by [Bob Atkey](https://bentnib.org/)
  + Mechanization of Binders by [Kathrin Stark](https://www.k-stark.de/)
  + Category Theory for Semantics by [Vikraman Choudhury](https://vikraman.org/)
  + Protocol Verification by [Andr√©s Goens](https://goens.org/)
  + Effects and Handlers by [Sam Lindley](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley/)
  + Applied Category Theory by [Jules Hedges](https://julesh.com/)

SPLV is not just about learning; there were plenty of social acitivies as well.
Monday night saw an informal 'Pizza & Drinks' reception held at the University, and the school dinner was held at a local resturant on the Tuesday.
The excursion was on Wednesday afternoon where participants had the opportunity to explore Pollok Country Park, and come face-to-face with a menagerie of wildlife that included Highland Coos!

Finally, SPLV 2024 could not have been realised without the help of the sponsors:

  + Gold Sponsor: [Quantinuum](https://www.quantinuum.com/)
  + Bronze: [Tweag](https://tweag.io/) and [Well-Typed](https://www.well-typed.com/).

[SICSA](https://www.sicsa.ac.uk/)
played an important role in supporting the attendance of students from SICSA-affiliated Universities.
