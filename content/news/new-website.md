SPLI has a new website! We will use this site to publicise all SPLI events, as well as news that will be of interest to the Scottish PL community.

We're also happy that we now have our own domain name, [spli.scot](https://spli.scot). You may notice that some of your old bookmarks will redirect you to the new domain.

We have also started a [Mastodon](https://mastodon.scot/@spli) account, and continue to update our account on [X](https://x.com/scottish_pli).
